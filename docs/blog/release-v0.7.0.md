---

Today I'm releasing Crawl4AI v0.7.0—the Adaptive Intelligence Update. This release introduces fundamental improvements in how Crawl4AI handles modern web complexity through adaptive learning, intelligent content discovery, and advanced extraction capabilities.

## 🎯 What's New at a Glance

- **Adaptive Crawling**: Your crawler now learns and adapts to website patterns
- **Virtual Scroll Support**: Complete content extraction from infinite scroll pages
- **Link Preview with 3-Layer Scoring**: Intelligent link analysis and prioritization
- **Async URL Seeder**: Discover thousands of URLs in seconds with intelligent filtering
- **PDF Parsing**: Extract data from PDF documents
- **Performance Optimizations**: Significant speed and memory improvements

## 🧠 Adaptive Crawling: Intelligence Through Pattern Learning

**The Problem:** Websites change. Class names shift. IDs disappear. Your carefully crafted selectors break at 3 AM, and you wake up to empty datasets and angry stakeholders.

**My Solution:** I implemented an adaptive learning system that observes patterns, builds confidence scores, and adjusts extraction strategies on the fly. It's like having a junior developer who gets better at their job with every page they scrape.

### Technical Deep-Dive

The Adaptive Crawler maintains a persistent state for each domain, tracking:
- Pattern success rates
- Selector stability over time  
- Content structure variations
- Extraction confidence scores

```python
from crawl4ai import AdaptiveCrawler, AdaptiveConfig, CrawlState

# Initialize with custom learning parameters
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    confidence_threshold=0.7,    # Min confidence to use learned patterns
    max_history=100,            # Remember last 100 crawls per domain
    learning_rate=0.2,          # How quickly to adapt to changes
    patterns_per_page=3,        # Patterns to learn per page type
    extraction_strategy='css'   # 'css' or 'xpath'
)

adaptive_crawler = AdaptiveCrawler(config)

# First crawl - crawler learns the structure
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        "https://news.example.com/article/12345",
        config=CrawlerRunConfig(
            adaptive_config=config,
            extraction_hints={  # Optional hints to speed up learning
                "title": "article h1",
                "content": "article .body-content"
            }
        )
    )
    
    # Crawler identifies and stores patterns
    if result.success:
        state = adaptive_crawler.get_state("news.example.com")
        print(f"Learned {len(state.patterns)} patterns")
        print(f"Confidence: {state.avg_confidence:.2%}")

# Subsequent crawls - uses learned patterns
result2 = await crawler.arun(
    "https://news.example.com/article/67890",
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(adaptive_config=config)
)
# Automatically extracts using learned patterns!
```

**Expected Real-World Impact:**
- **News Aggregation**: Maintain 95%+ extraction accuracy even as news sites update their templates
- **E-commerce Monitoring**: Track product changes across hundreds of stores without constant maintenance
- **Research Data Collection**: Build robust academic datasets that survive website redesigns
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Cut selector update time by 80% for frequently-changing sites

## 🌊 Virtual Scroll: Complete Content Capture

**The Problem:** Modern web apps only render what's visible. Scroll down, new content appears, old content vanishes into the void. Traditional crawlers capture that first viewport and miss 90% of the content. It's like reading only the first page of every book.

**My Solution:** I built Virtual Scroll support that mimics human browsing behavior, capturing content as it loads and preserving it before the browser's garbage collector strikes.

### Implementation Details

```python
from crawl4ai import VirtualScrollConfig

# For social media feeds (Twitter/X style)
twitter_config = VirtualScrollConfig(
    container_selector="[data-testid='primaryColumn']",
    scroll_count=20,                    # Number of scrolls
    scroll_by="container_height",       # Smart scrolling by container size
    wait_after_scroll=1.0,             # Let content load
    capture_method="incremental",       # Capture new content on each scroll
    deduplicate=True                   # Remove duplicate elements
)

# For e-commerce product grids (Instagram style)
grid_config = VirtualScrollConfig(
    container_selector="main .product-grid",
    scroll_count=30,
    scroll_by=800,                     # Fixed pixel scrolling
    wait_after_scroll=1.5,             # Images need time
    stop_on_no_change=True            # Smart stopping
)

# For news feeds with lazy loading
news_config = VirtualScrollConfig(
    container_selector=".article-feed",
    scroll_count=50,
    scroll_by="page_height",           # Viewport-based scrolling
    wait_after_scroll=0.5,
    wait_for_selector=".article-card",  # Wait for specific elements
    timeout=30000                      # Max 30 seconds total
)

# Use it in your crawl
async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(
        "https://twitter.com/trending",
        config=CrawlerRunConfig(
            virtual_scroll_config=twitter_config,
            # Combine with other features
            extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy({
                "tweets": {
                    "selector": "[data-testid='tweet']",
                    "fields": {
                        "text": {"selector": "[data-testid='tweetText']", "type": "text"},
                        "likes": {"selector": "[data-testid='like']", "type": "text"}
                    }
                }
            })
        )
    )
    
    print(f"Captured {len(result.extracted_content['tweets'])} tweets")
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **DOM Recycling Awareness**: Detects and handles virtual DOM element recycling
- **Smart Scroll Physics**: Three modes - container height, page height, or fixed pixels
- **Content Preservation**: Captures content before it's destroyed
- **Intelligent Stopping**: Stops when no new content appears
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams content instead of holding everything in memory

**Expected Real-World Impact:**
- **Social Media Analysis**: Capture entire Twitter threads with hundreds of replies, not just top 10
- **E-commerce Scraping**: Extract 500+ products from infinite scroll catalogs vs. 20-50 with traditional methods  
- **News Aggregation**: Get all articles from modern news sites, not just above-the-fold content
- **Research Applications**: Complete data extraction from academic databases using virtual pagination

## 🔗 Link Preview: Intelligent Link Analysis and Scoring

**The Problem:** You crawl a page and get 200 links. Which ones matter? Which lead to the content you actually want? Traditional crawlers force you to follow everything or build complex filters.

**My Solution:** I implemented a three-layer scoring system that analyzes links like a human would—considering their position, context, and relevance to your goals.

### The Three-Layer Scoring System

```python
from crawl4ai import LinkPreviewConfig

# Configure intelligent link analysis
link_config = LinkPreviewConfig(
    # What to analyze
    include_internal=True,
    include_external=True,
    max_links=100,              # Analyze top 100 links
    
    # Relevance scoring
    query="machine learning tutorials",  # Your interest
    score_threshold=0.3,        # Minimum relevance score
    
    # Performance
    concurrent_requests=10,     # Parallel processing
    timeout_per_link=5000,      # 5s per link
    
    # Advanced scoring weights
    scoring_weights={
        "intrinsic": 0.3,       # Link quality indicators
        "contextual": 0.5,      # Relevance to query
        "popularity": 0.2       # Link prominence
    }
)

# Use in your crawl
result = await crawler.arun(
    "https://tech-blog.example.com",
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(
        link_preview_config=link_config,
        score_links=True
    )
)

# Access scored and sorted links
for link in result.links["internal"][:10]:  # Top 10 internal links
    print(f"Score: {link['total_score']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Intrinsic: {link['intrinsic_score']:.1f}/10")  # Position, attributes
    print(f"  Contextual: {link['contextual_score']:.1f}/1")  # Relevance to query
    print(f"  URL: {link['href']}")
    print(f"  Title: {link['head_data']['title']}")
    print(f"  Description: {link['head_data']['meta']['description'][:100]}...")
```

**Scoring Components:**

1. **Intrinsic Score (0-10)**: Based on link quality indicators
   - Position on page (navigation, content, footer)
   - Link attributes (rel, title, class names)
   - Anchor text quality and length
   - URL structure and depth

2. **Contextual Score (0-1)**: Relevance to your query
   - Semantic similarity using embeddings
   - Keyword matching in link text and title
   - Meta description analysis
   - Content preview scoring

3. **Total Score**: Weighted combination for final ranking

**Expected Real-World Impact:**
- **Research Efficiency**: Find relevant papers 10x faster by following only high-score links
- **Competitive Analysis**: Automatically identify important pages on competitor sites
- **Content Discovery**: Build topic-focused crawlers that stay on track
- **SEO Audits**: Identify and prioritize high-value internal linking opportunities

## 🎣 Async URL Seeder: Automated URL Discovery at Scale

**The Problem:** You want to crawl an entire domain but only have the homepage. Or worse, you want specific content types across thousands of pages. Manual URL discovery? That's a job for machines, not humans.

**My Solution:** I built Async URL Seeder—a turbocharged URL discovery engine that combines multiple sources with intelligent filtering and relevance scoring.

### Technical Architecture

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncUrlSeeder, SeedingConfig

# Basic discovery - find all product pages
seeder_config = SeedingConfig(
    # Discovery sources
    source="sitemap+cc",        # Sitemap + Common Crawl
    
    # Filtering
    pattern="*/product/*",      # URL pattern matching
    ignore_patterns=["*/reviews/*", "*/questions/*"],
    
    # Validation
    live_check=True,           # Verify URLs are alive
    max_urls=5000,             # Stop at 5000 URLs
    
    # Performance  
    concurrency=100,           # Parallel requests
    hits_per_sec=10           # Rate limiting
)

seeder = AsyncUrlSeeder(seeder_config)
urls = await seeder.discover("https://shop.example.com")

# Advanced: Relevance-based discovery
research_config = SeedingConfig(
    source="crawl+sitemap",    # Deep crawl + sitemap
    pattern="*/blog/*",        # Blog posts only
    
    # Content relevance
    extract_head=True,         # Get meta tags
    query="quantum computing tutorials",
    scoring_method="bm25",     # Or "semantic" (coming soon)
    score_threshold=0.4,       # High relevance only
    
    # Smart filtering
    filter_nonsense_urls=True,  # Remove .xml, .txt, etc.
    min_content_length=500,     # Skip thin content
    
    force=True                 # Bypass cache
)

# Discover with progress tracking
discovered = []
async for batch in seeder.discover_iter("https://physics-blog.com", research_config):
    discovered.extend(batch)
    print(f"Found {len(discovered)} relevant URLs so far...")

# Results include scores and metadata
for url_data in discovered[:5]:
    print(f"URL: {url_data['url']}")
    print(f"Score: {url_data['score']:.3f}")
    print(f"Title: {url_data['title']}")
```

**Discovery Methods:**
- **Sitemap Mining**: Parses robots.txt and all linked sitemaps
- **Common Crawl**: Queries the Common Crawl index for historical URLs
- **Intelligent Crawling**: Follows links with smart depth control
- **Pattern Analysis**: Learns URL structures and generates variations

**Expected Real-World Impact:**
- **Migration Projects**: Discover 10,000+ URLs from legacy sites in under 60 seconds
- **Market Research**: Map entire competitor ecosystems automatically
- **Academic Research**: Build comprehensive datasets without manual URL collection
- **SEO Audits**: Find every indexable page with content scoring
- **Content Archival**: Ensure no content is left behind during site migrations

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

This release includes significant performance improvements through optimized resource handling, better concurrency management, and reduced memory footprint.

### What We Optimized

```python
# Before v0.7.0 (slow)
results = []
for url in urls:
    result = await crawler.arun(url)
    results.append(result)

# After v0.7.0 (fast)
# Automatic batching and connection pooling
results = await crawler.arun_batch(
    urls,
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(
        # New performance options
        batch_size=10,              # Process 10 URLs concurrently
        reuse_browser=True,         # Keep browser warm
        eager_loading=False,        # Load only what's needed
        streaming_extraction=True,  # Stream large extractions
        
        # Optimized defaults
        wait_until="domcontentloaded",  # Faster than networkidle
        exclude_external_resources=True, # Skip third-party assets
        block_ads=True                  # Ad blocking built-in
    )
)

# Memory-efficient streaming for large crawls
async for result in crawler.arun_stream(large_url_list):
    # Process results as they complete
    await process_result(result)
    # Memory is freed after each iteration
```

**Performance Gains:**
- **Startup Time**: 70% faster browser initialization
- **Page Loading**: 40% reduction with smart resource blocking
- **Extraction**: 3x faster with compiled CSS selectors
- **Memory Usage**: 60% reduction with streaming processing
- **Concurrent Crawls**: Handle 5x more parallel requests

## 📄 PDF Support

PDF extraction is now natively supported in Crawl4AI.

```python
# Extract data from PDF documents
result = await crawler.arun(
    "https://example.com/report.pdf",
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(
        pdf_extraction=True,
        extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy({
            # Works on converted PDF structure
            "title": {"selector": "h1", "type": "text"},
            "sections": {"selector": "h2", "type": "list"}
        })
    )
)
```

## 🔧 Important Changes
